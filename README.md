# Multimodal Approach on Detecting Autism with Videos and Questionnaire Data

## Overview

Welcome to our project on using a **Multimodal Approach for Detecting Autism**. We're developing a system that combines video recordings and questionnaire data to predict the likelihood of autism in individuals.

## Dataset

Our primary dataset for this project is the **Self-stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD)**. This dataset offers video recordings of individuals along with questionnaire responses, giving us a comprehensive view of their behavior and characteristics.

## How It Works

We're taking a multimodal approach by analyzing both video and questionnaire data. Machine learning algorithms, including **DenseNet** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, are employed to create a robust prediction model.

## Importance

Early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is essential for effective intervention. By integrating various data sources, our goal is to enhance the accuracy of autism detection and provide valuable insights for early support.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required software listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the provided Jupyter Notebook files to understand the code and experiments.
4. Follow the notebook instructions to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results

We're evaluating our models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results can be found in the project's Jupyter Notebook files. We achived accuracy of 70% with SSBD data.

## Future Plans

Our project is a stepping stone to more advancements:
- Expanding the dataset for better model generalization.
- Exploring advanced neural network architectures and ensemble techniques.
- Enhancing model interpretability for clearer decision insights.
